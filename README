== Getting Started

This is a Rails3 application that has been built within an Ubuntu 10.04 operating system using RVM to manage the Rails environment.

1. Clone this Github project via:
        <tt>git clone http://github.com/carlpulley/log_mysteries</tt>

2. Ensure all gem dependencies are successfully installed with:
        <tt>bundle install</tt>

3. Build your SQLite3 database with:
        <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>

4. Ensure the testing database uses the same DB shcema with:
        <tt>rake db:test:load</tt>

5. Build the SQLite3 database with:
        <tt>rake db:seed</tt>

6. Ensure that all unit tests pass successfully with:
        <tt>rake test:units</tt>

Finally, you may now run this Rails3 application using:
        <tt>rails server</tt> or <tt>rails s</tt>
and navigating to the URL http://localhost:3000/.

== Description of (Significant) Contents

The significant directory structure for this Rails3 application is as follows:

  |-- app
  |   |-- controllers
  |   |-- models
  |   `-- views
  |       `-- layouts
  |-- lib
  |   `-- tasks
  `-- test
      `-- unit

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like report_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like apache_access.rb. Models descend from
  ActiveRecord::Base by default.

app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  report/index.html.erb for the ReportController#index action. All views use
  eRuby syntax by default. Different view formats (eg. CSV and PDF) are supported.

app/views/layouts
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the
  common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout
  using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb.
  Inside default.html.erb, call <% yield %> to render the view using this
  layout.

lib/tasks
  All rake based processing tasks are stored here.

test/unit
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate
  command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this
  directory.
